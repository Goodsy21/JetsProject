# JETS PROGRAM

## DESCRIPTION
This Program uses a text file of jet/plane info to create an app regarding Jet info. Info includes the plane type, model, max speed, max range and price. It also allows users to add a plane to the fleet or remove one, and consider those for fastest and longest range values as well as place them into the proper categories of jet where they belong, if they belong. You can also choose to initiate a Dogfight which pits all fighter jet types against one another. Or, if you oppose violence you can load all passengers and go home.

## LESSONS LEARNED
Don't move apartments in the middle of a boot camp. I still need to figure out how implementation and inheritance work. I was able to get the code working through assistance from Eclipse telling me to make methods and what not. There are probably better ways to write the for loops but, for now I just needed to get this into a working program at LEAST! The struggle continues. I need to sleep. 

Revisions:
When fixing my project, I moved a lot of methods from JetApplication to Airfield. In doing so, I had to rename a lot of things. I learned that I could replace them all at once by searching the word with cmd f, so I did that. WHich I thought was awesome, until I realized the difference between searching 'fleet' and '.fleet' or 'fleet ' makes a huge difference in regards to replacing the right words. Similar to RE. 



## FOLLOW UP
Go over instanceof
Creating a method that could be used in both the reader and the addJets so code isn't so repetitive. 
Better understanding of interface, and when it would be used
