# JETS PROGRAM

## DESCRIPTION
This Program uses a text file of jet/plane info to create an app regarding Jet info. Info includes the plane type, model, max speed, max range and price. It also allows users to add a plane to the fleet or remove one, and consider those for fastest and longest range values. It's not the prettiest girl at the dance, but she'll dance.

## LESSONS LEARNED
Don't move apartments in the middle of a boot camp. I still need to figure out how implementation and inheritance work. I was able to get the code working through assistance from Eclipse telling me to make methods and what not. There are probably better ways to write the for loops but, for now I just needed to get this into a working program at LEAST! The struggle continues. I need to sleep.
